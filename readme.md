## What
Are you in [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) and don't know what to do in the weekend?
[Here are some options.](https://blaze-3.github.io/blrgame/)

## ToDo
- [x] Enter data
- [x] Represent data in a list on a webpage
- [x] Make them cards
- [ ] What about a card slideshow?
- [ ] Let people mark visited places. Store data in their browser
- [ ] Add dark mode
- [ ] Make it a PWA
- [ ] Get a nice memorable domain
- [ ] Get more people using & contributing
- [ ] Add links (what kind? google maps?)
- [ ] Add categories (e.g. location / kind of activity / time)
- [ ] Add Kannada version
- [ ] Provide ability to share list of places between users
- [ ] Validate data to see if places still exist (looking at you, SMAAASH)
- [ ] Provide a way for people to contribute places without a GitHub account
- [ ] Write a contribution.md (better community standards hehehe)
- [ ] Recognize contributors

## Contributions
Feel free to add more activities or finish off stuff in the todo or anything else you like!  
Before you start working on something please open an issue / discussion so others will know and work won't be duplicated.  
At this time the goal is to keep this app serverless and distribute through GitHub pages so cash can be saved :)

If you want to contribute an activity, please provide these fields:
* Name (basically a short description including the place name, e.g. 'Picnic at Cubbon Park')

If you want to add a place directly, you can do so by appending it in [`data/places.json`](./data/places.json)
